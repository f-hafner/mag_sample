```


## Linking scores 

- conditioning on link score > 0.7 is fine 

```{r}

linked_advisors %>%
  left_join(linking_info, by = "iteration_id") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = link_score)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 100, aes( y = ..density..)) +
  facet_wrap(~field)

```

## Link performance by graduation year

- fraction of listed advisors where the link_score is above the treshold
- the mean link score for advisors where dedupe finds a link (link_score is not NA)
- NOTE: the field here is assigned based on the first reported in the dissertation, and the crosswalked to the MAG field
  - in the figure above, we used the field from iteration_id, but this only works for advisors that dedupe suggests to be a link 

```{r}

keep_fields <- c("biology", "chemistry", "computer science", 
                 "economics", "engineering", "environmental science", 
                 "geography", "geology", "mathetmatics", "physics",
                 "political science", "psychology", "sociology")

score_by_year <- theses %>% 
  filter(degree_year >= 1985) %>%
  left_join(linked_advisors,
            by = "relationship_id") %>%
  left_join(pq_fields_mag, by = "goid") %>%
  filter(field %in% keep_fields)

# %>%
#   left_join(linking_info,
#             by = "iteration_id")

score_by_year %>%
  mutate(link_score_adj = ifelse(is.na(link_score), -1, link_score)) %>%
  group_by(degree_year, field) %>%
  summarise(mean_score = mean(link_score, na.rm = TRUE),
            #p50_score = quantile(link_score, probs = 0.5),
            share_linked = mean(link_score_adj > min_score_advisors),
            .groups = "drop") %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = all_of(c("mean_score", "share_linked")),
               names_to = "stat") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = degree_year, y = value)) + 
  geom_line(aes(linetype = stat)) + 
  facet_wrap(~field) + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```


```{r}

score_by_year %>%
  filter(field == "biology") %>% 
  filter(is.na(link_score)) %>% 
  filter(degree_year < 2000) %>% 
  group_by(firstname, lastname, uni_name, degree_year) %>%
  summarise(nb = n(),
            .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(desc(nb)) %>%
  head(10)

# score_by_year %>% filter(lastname == "dasgupta" & firstname == "asim" & !is.na(iteration_id)) # never linked 
# score_by_year %>% filter(lastname == "freeling" & firstname == "michael") # never linked 

# scale this up? check all the main fields of the authors with such names? -- tedious 
```

### Notes 


- Reasons for why advisor not linked
  - they are not sampled for linking either in the mag or proquest data
    - most plausibly because they are assigned to different fields 
  - institution names do not overlap 
  - dedupe does not find a link even though it should
    - but how can it explain the time trend?
- Comparing fields in MAG and ProQuest dissertations
  - General
    - not linking an advisor in biology does not mean do not link them in chemistry if the thesis is also classified in chemistry
    - in the data above, this happens if biology is listed at position 0
  - Biology 
    - main field chemistry: gerlt, cooperman, eveleigh (two of them with long careers, but both in chemistry), tsai
    - main field bioloyg: dasgupta, freeling
    - at least one of the dissertations of freeling are sampled for the linking 
  - Sociology
    - different main field: ishisaka, coulton (medicine), howell (geography), mindel (psychology)
    - not in MAG, but findable on google: khleif, gullerud
    - not in MAG, not findable on google: liff
- Next steps
  - widen the sampled field in MAG 
  - re-train and re-check 


Here is some python code to look at the learned settings, based on

- https://github.com/dedupeio/rlr/blob/master/rlr/lr.py (new dedupe does not use this anymore I think)
- https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe/blob/5742efc7fc696c06d3327e038541532e584551a8/dedupe/api.py
- Note: The predicates are similar for all three fields I looked at. I do not know how the weights correspond to the logit regression coefficients

```python

sf_biology = "/mnt/ssd/DedupeFiles/advisors/settings_biology_1985_2022_institutionTrue_fieldofstudy_catFalse_fieldofstudy_strFalse_keywordsFalsechristoph_baseline_update"
sf_chemistry = "/mnt/ssd/DedupeFiles/advisors/settings_chemistry_1985_2022_institutionTrue_fieldofstudy_catFalse_fieldofstudy_strFalse_keywordsFalsechristoph_baseline_update"
sf_cs = "/mnt/ssd/DedupeFiles/advisors/settings_computer_science_1985_2022_institutionTrue_fieldofstudy_catFalse_fieldofstudy_strFalse_keywordsFalsechristoph_baseline_update"

with open(sf_biology, "rb") as sf:
    linker_biology = dedupe.StaticRecordLink(sf)

with open(sf_chemistry, "rb") as sf:
    linker_chemistry = dedupe.StaticRecordLink(sf)


with open(sf_cs, "rb") as sf:
    linker_cs = dedupe.StaticRecordLink(sf)

linker_biology.predicates
linker_chemistry.predicates
linker_cs.predicates

linker_biology.classifier.weights
linker_chemistry.classifier.weights
linker_cs.classifier.weights

```



## Number of linked advisors 

- not sure this is still relevant?

```{r}
score_by_year %>%
  filter(!is.na(link_score)
          & field %in% keep_fields) %>%
  group_by(degree_year, field) %>%
  summarise(n_advisors = n(),
            .groups = "drop") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = degree_year, y = n_advisors)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~field)

```

old comments

- for instance, a student of michael j lambert (authorid 2120159045; relationship id 303670971_0 in proquest) from pre-1990 is link score of 0.02, but should be a clear link


## Compare number of links across iterations within fields 

```{r}
fields_iter_compare <- c("economics", "chemistry")
min_score <- 0.8

keep_iter_ids <- tbl(con, "linking_info_advisors") %>%
  filter(field %in% fields_iter_compare) %>%
  filter(testing == 0) %>%
  collect() %>%
  group_by(field, train_name) %>%
  arrange(iteration_id) %>%
  mutate(nb = n(),
         id = row_number()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(id == nb) %>%
  select(iteration_id, field, train_name)

linked_ids_to_compare <- tbl(con, "linked_ids_advisors") %>%
  inner_join(
    tbl(con, "linking_info_advisors") %>%
      filter(field %in% fields_iter_compare),
    by = "iteration_id"
  ) %>%
  inner_join(
    tbl(con, "pq_advisors") %>%
      select(relationship_id, goid),
    by = "relationship_id"
  ) %>%
  inner_join(
    tbl(con, "pq_authors") %>%
      select(goid, degree_year),
    by = "goid"
  ) %>%
  collect() %>%
  filter(iteration_id %in% keep_iter_ids$iteration_id) 

```


Number of graduates with at least 1 advisor

```{r}

d_sum <- linked_ids_to_compare %>%
  filter(link_score >= min_score) %>%
  group_by(train_name, field, degree_year) %>%
  summarise(n_advisors = n(),
            n_graduates = n_distinct(goid),
            .groups = "drop") %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("n_"), names_to = "variable")

plotvars <- c("n_graduates")

map(.x = plotvars,
    .f = ~d_sum %>%
      filter(variable == .x) %>%
      ggplot(aes(x = degree_year, y = value)) +
      geom_line(aes(linetype = train_name)) + 
      facet_wrap(~field) + 
      theme(legend.position = "bottom") + 
      labs(title = paste0("Count: ", .x))
    )


```

## Fraction of theses with at least 1 supervisor linked to MAG

```{r}
s_thesis_advisor_link <- theses %>%
  filter(degree_year %in% 1990:2015) %>%
  left_join(linked_advisors %>%
              filter(link_score > min_score_advisors) %>%
              select(relationship_id) %>%
              mutate(linked = 1),
            by = "relationship_id") %>%
  mutate(linked = ifelse(is.na(linked), 0, linked)) %>%
  group_by(goid) %>%
  mutate(any_link = max(linked)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(!duplicated(goid)) %>%
  group_by(degree_year, any_link, fieldname0_mag) %>%
  summarise(n_theses = n(), 
            .groups = "drop") %>%
  group_by(degree_year, fieldname0_mag) %>%
  mutate(s = n_theses / sum(n_theses)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(any_link == 1)
```


```{r}

s_thesis_advisor_link %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = degree_year, y = s)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~fieldname0_mag) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1995, 2005, 2015)) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, color = "grey55", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(y = "Share", title = "Share of US theses with >=1 supervisor linked to MAG",
       subtitle = "Where >= 1 supervisor reported; by first indicated field0 of thesis.")

```

### Notes

- Idea: since supervisors tend to be established researchers and publish regularly, we should find a large fraction of supervisors reported in ProQuest in the MAG data.

- The split by field is not exact because the link may have been found using a different reported field0.

- The close to 100% is reassuring of the MAG data quality on affiliations in these fields.

- Fields of concern: physics, sociology, poli science, biology (the level, the break and the trend).
