# mag_sample
This is some sample code from a private repo that uses data from Microsoft Academic Graph. 
The repo is intended to show some of my coding work. 
See open issues for some features that are currently lacking. 


## Overview
The `pipeline.sh` script calls consecutively all the relevant scripts for 
- setting up the sqlite database with Microsoft Academic Data 
- preparing additional tables for analysis
- loading the ProQuest data into the database 
- linking records between MAG and ProQuest
- making some reports about the data and linking quality
