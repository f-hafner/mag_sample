\item \textit{Note: } 
\item The table summarises the links found from from ProQuest graduates to MAG authors. Graduates are defined as the authors of the dissertations in ProQuest. First, the columns headed by ``Fraction of links found'' compare the identified links across two different labellers as described in the text. The columns show the fraction of links found for two training sets constructed by two different labellers. ``Same entity'' are graduates for which the models trained on the different training sets find the same MAG identifier. ``Only by 1'' and ``Only by 2'' are graduates for which only the model trained on either of the training sets found a link to MAG at all. ``Different entity'' are graduates for which both models find links to MAG, but to different identifiers. Second, the last column reports the total number of links found for each field, after all postprocessing (see text for details). Third, the last row reports the total across fields. The fractions are weighted by the number of graduates in the respective fields in ProQuest 1990--2015.
