# enviroment for science-career. "test" b/c currently not used directly. 
  # install the env with `conda activate; conda env create --file science-career-tempenv.yml` from the directory where this file is.
# Idea: use it for linking; try out how it works otherwise, and update the file as necessary. eventually, add it as default env to the project

# Other notes
  # use python==3.9: when using >=3.8, it uses 3.10. I have a local installation for this, and various packages.
    # Now conda will first use these https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62352699/conda-uses-local-packages
    # Instead of deleting all the packages in ~/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages (and possibly breaking some scripts),
      # for now I just use a python version that is not locally installed to circumvent the problem.
